## WATÂ¿

I am sometimes known as Ross, and the pages contained herewithin are the results of  my various stumbling and flailing around with computers.  I am particularly interested in metaprogramming,  hardware & eletronics, low level stuff, functional programming and squirrels.  Anything and everything could appear here, however.

I speak occasionally on stuff, you can find some videos [here](https://skillsmatter.com/legacy_profile/ross-mckinlay#skillscasts) (unfortunately, SkillsMatter no longer exists and neither do the videos!  You'll just have to use your imagination.)

This blog is generated using [frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog) - a Racket based static blog generation tool.

If you got redirected here from a broken link, it is likely because I changed my blog at some point. You can still find all the posts.
