<h2>A LONG TIME AGO, IN A GALAXY FAR AWAY…..</h2>  <p>Having infiltrated the Empire’s data centre, you are not overly surprised to discover they are using some ancient system from the old republic days.&#160; A brief look around reveals a monstrous legacy Empire Enterprise system.&#160; It has a ORM you thought had died out millennia ago.&#160; You can immediately see no less than 13 layers of inheritance, 6 levels of dependency injection, and some complete bastard has spread the evil EmpireAutoLogger all over the place</p>  <p><a href="http://www.pinksquirrellabs.com/image.axd?picture=r11.png"><img title="r11" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 8px 0px 12px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="r11" src="http://www.pinksquirrellabs.com/image.axd?picture=r11_thumb.png" width="640" height="341" /></a></p>  <p>Thankfully, being a Jedi fighting for the Rebellion, you have access to both the force and the latest database access technology, F# type providers.&#160; Using this power, you are able to access the remote database controls, where a large crane/arm can be manoeuvred in order to pickup the legacy hard drive containing the Death Star plans.</p>  <p>There is one problem.&#160; The lag here is terrible, the Empire are onto you, and the location of the disk in questionable.&#160; In fact, it seems the longer you take to get the crane into position (IN REAL TIME!), the more likely the disk is to change position completely.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.pinksquirrellabs.com/image.axd?picture=r12.png"><img title="r12" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 8px 0px 12px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="r12" src="http://www.pinksquirrellabs.com/image.axd?picture=r12_thumb.png" width="462" height="480" /></a></p>  <p>Can you grab the disk before it is too late?</p>  <h3>TO HELP THE REBELLION!</h3>  <p>(NOTE. You MUST change your tooltip font to a monospace font. I suggest Lucida Console in at least 16pt.)</p>  <p><a href="https://github.com/pezipink/InteractiveProvider">Grab the InteractiveProvider from my github here</a>, build it, then create a script file and reference the type provider. Since the InteractiveProvider dynamically loads assemblies that contain types implementing the interfaces it is looking for, you will have to tell it as a static parameter the directory that the rogue one dll resides in.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.pinksquirrellabs.com/image.axd?picture=r3.png"><img title="r3" style="margin: 8px 0px 12px; display: inline" alt="r3" src="http://www.pinksquirrellabs.com/image.axd?picture=r3_thumb.png" width="1024" height="169" /></a></p>  <p>May the force be with you, always.</p>
