<p>This is "Dark Squirrel" in its current state! Many updates since my last "release" (lol) including colours for XAML (yes - where squirrels meet camels!), and many matrix-style updated colours/fonts on dockable windows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The attached archive is my font and colour settings for VS2008, and the font that I use called Dina, which can be found at http://www.proggyfonts.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>Samples:</p>
<p>C#</p>

<p>XML / Config</p>

<p>HTML</p>

<p></p>
<p>I must admit I have no idea what CSS looks like, but that's ok because you won't be looking at CSS will you? :) Javascript is done as well, C++ also looks good. As does VB.NET - but you won't that using that either, right? :)</p>
<p>Comments / suggestions welcome!</p>
