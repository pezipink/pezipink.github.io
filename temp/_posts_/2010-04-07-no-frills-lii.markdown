<p>LII is an entity that knows nothing to start with, but learns about how to form sentences as you talk to it. This can lead to highly amusing covnersations, that become eerily more human-like the more you teach it. Have a play!</p>
<p>LII will ignore some punctuation for the time being. Try to make sure you spell stuff correctly otherwise it will think you are using new words.</p>
<p>(disclaimer: I knocked the Silveright console together in 10 minutes, and no it is not pretty, I will tart it up a bit later!)</p>
